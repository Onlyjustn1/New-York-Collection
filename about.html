	<p>Living the life in New York is quite relaxing, it can have it's hazey days not going to lie but in the end if you have the right people life can be well. Art has been all in my life, I start art when I was just a 4 year old kid. My Mother bought me a chalkboard and a whiteboard. So I would use it most of the time and just free draw.</p>
